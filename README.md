# light-spectrum
Controller and arduino code to make a LED strip act like an audio spectrum on windows.

Hook up your arduino to your pc and write the program to it.
Then run the program in VisualStudio and it should respond to your audio.
Uses ColorMine for light calculation and CSCore for audio analysis. 
I will be updating this with a UI sometime.
